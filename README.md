# Labyrinth
This is the source code for three modules which together is the base for the labyrinth/pok√©mon game.
It is written in Haskell and use the Haste compiler to build a Javascript file.
See the example directory for an example of how it can be used.

It works with Haste version 0.5.5.1 and ghc 7.10.3 (did not work with Haste 0.6.0.0 and same ghc).

Credits to the Haste Compiler making all this possible
