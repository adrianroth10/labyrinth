# Labyrinth
This is the source code for three modules which together makes a base for the labyrinth/pok√©mon game.
It is written in Haskell and then uses the Haste compiler to make a Javascript file which can be run in a browser.
See the example directory for an example of how it can be used.

It works with Haste version 0.5.5.1 and ghc 7.10.3 (did not work with Haste 0.6.0.0 and same ghc).

Credits to the Haste Compiler making all this possible
